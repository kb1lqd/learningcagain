I'm going to re-learn C, fill in the gaps, and learn how to do more on a normal computer rather than just small 16-bit embeded environments.

This readme will be a note-pad of info/commands that I find useful.

# Visual Studio Commands

Compiling a basic file:

'''
gcc -g main.c -o main.exe
'''

Compiling 2 files together:

'''
gcc -g .\main.c .\support.c -o extern.exe
'''
